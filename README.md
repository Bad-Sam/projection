## Description

Trapped as a test subject in a laboratory doing shady experiments on humans, you must overcome five experiments the scientists have designed. Work with your controllable shadow and interact with your environment to find a cunning way to survive each experiment. But beware, the shadow plane doesn't behave by the same rules you may be used to.
